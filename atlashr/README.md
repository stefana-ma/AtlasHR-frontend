## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

Framework: React with TypeScript

UI Library: Material UI (MUI) for fast and consistent design

Routing: React Router with protected routes by role.

State Management: Local state with hooks; tokens stored in localStorage (absolutely not the best, smth to improve)

Services Layer: Axios-based API services (authService, absenceService, feedbackService) to keep components as clean as possible

Role-based Views:
-Manager: can see all data, and can edit (not implemented yet)
-Employee: can request absences
-Co-worker: leave feedback, can view limited data (not implemented yet)

## ‚ú® Future Improvements

Add global state management (Redux or React Query)

Improve error handling

Add form validation with Formik + Yup

Add testing (React Testing Library, Cypress)

Use Docker Compose for easy local setup

Improve UI/UX

Add auth context
